Hi, my name is OKURA Masafumi, a software developer based in Tokyo, Japan, focusing on Ruby/Rails.

## What I've beed working on recently

- I've beening developing a JSON Serializer for Ruby named [`Alba`](https://github.com/okuramasafumi/alba) for a few years now. It provides a few DSL to organize JSON well and is the fastest among the alternatives.
- I'm also organizing a large tech conference about Ruby on Rails called [`Kaigi on Rails`](https://kaigionrails.org). I'm the founder and chief organizer of the event. It started in 2020 and this time is the remote and domestic event for Japanese developers, but I'd like to make it an international one next year!
- I'm an organizer of a few Ruby meetups. I organize [`Grow.rb`](https://growrb.doorkeeper.jp/), [`Entaku.rb`](https://entakurb.doorkeeper.jp/) and [`Rubygems Code Reading Meetup`](https://rubygems-code-reading.connpass.com/). `Grow.rb` is a local meetup in Tokyo focusing on Ruby techniques but due to COVID-19 it's online from this spring. `Entaku.rb` is an online meetup from the beginning and is fosuing on discussions. `Rubygems Code Reading Meetup` is a meetup where we read the source code of famous ruby gems together.
- I translated a book, [Mastering Vim](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-vim) into Japanese.

## What I'm going to do in the future

- I love teaching. I've been a coach in [Rails Girls](https://railsgirls.com) for more than 10 times and now I'm going to have coaching sessions for more advanced developers. If you're interested in learning Ruby and Rails, please contact me via the email on my profile.
- I'd like to publish a book of my own. It'll be a book about Ruby on Rails and the basic of web technologies.
- I think I need to learn a new programming language, but have not decided which one yet. Maybe Rust?
